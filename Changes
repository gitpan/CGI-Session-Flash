Revision history for CGI-Session-Flash

Version 0.02 - November 21, 2008
    * Removed auto_cleanup parameter.  Instead we keep track of the cleanup
      process and don't allow it to be run more than once unless a force
      parameter is specified.
    * Added a cleanup_done accessor to note if the cleanup process has already
      taken place.
    * flush() now calls cleanup()
    * Documentation updates.  Specially note more about the automatic cleanup
      process and caveats.

Version 0.01 - March 25, 2008
    * First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
