CGI-Session-Flash

This module implements a Flash object.  A flash is session data with a
specific life cycle.  When you put something into the flash it stays there
until two C<cleanup> calls have been made.  What this generally means is
that in a web application the data in the flash will stay until the end
of the next request.  This allows you to use it for storing messages that
can be accessed after a redirect, but then are automatically cleaned up.
